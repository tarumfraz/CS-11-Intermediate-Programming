// This program generates a random integer between 1 and 10, and prompts the user to guess this
// integer in three guesses. It also gives the user correct feedback on whether their guess was
// too high or too low. If the integer is guessed correctly, the program halts. If not and the user
// has incorrectly input their third and final guess, the program halts and responds with the correct integer.
